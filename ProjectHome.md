The Quick Look plugin that handles source code in Leopard is, well, boring.  We developers expect syntax highlighting these days!  Thanks to [WebKit](http://webkit.org), [Highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/index.html), and the foresight of the Quick Look API designers, however, this is easy to achieve.  Just drop this plugin into `/Library/QuickLook` or `~/Library/QuickLook` and bask in the glow of the beautiful syntax highlighting!

A few features of note:
  * Zippy!  Snappy!  Really fast!
  * Support for thumbnailing
  * Support for binary `.plist` files
  * Support for lots of languages (but see the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/qlcolorcode/wiki/FAQ))
